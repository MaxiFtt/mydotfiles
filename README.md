## Qtile config file requirements

You can modify the config file according to your needs. However, if you don't want to change it, **you will need**:

* [scrot](https://www.tecmint.com/take-screenshots-in-linux-using-scrot/) for taking screenshots

* [rofi](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-and-install-rofi-on-linux-tutorial) for launching apps

* [brave-browser](https://brave.com/) to navigate

* [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/): a python module for the CPU widget

### Installing:

```bash
    sudo pacman -Sy scrot rofi
    paru brave-bin
    pip install psutil
```


## Where did I get the icons for the top bar?

If you want to choose your own icons, visit the [font awesome cheatsheet](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/cheatsheet/) and just copy and paste the icons you like into the config file.
